\title{Whipple's index calculation for reproductive-age females
}

\usage{
heaping(x, a, b)
}

\description{
The function provides the Whipple's index of females 15 to 49 years old who are in reproductive age with data quality.
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
a data vector of females, aged 15 to 49 year.
}
\item{a}{
Choose the starting age for the calculation of Whipple's index.
}
\item{b}{
Choose the ending age for the calculation of Whipple's index.
}
}
\details{Whipple's indes can be computed by the following formula
\deqn{WI=\left(\frac{P_{25}+P_{30}+P_{35}+\cdots\cdots+P_{60}}{P_{23}+P_{24}+P_{25}+\cdots\cdots+P_{62}}\right)\times500}
where P represents the population of reported age in completed year. There are 5 categories for the index value, ranging from very rough to highly accurate. Data is classified as being very rough (if WI > 175), rough (125 < WI < 175), approximate (110 < WI < 125), accurate (105 < WI < 110) and highly accurate (WI < 105).
}
\value{
heaping computes the Whipple's index with the quality of age reporting.
